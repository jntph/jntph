- 👋 Hello, I’m Janna, an aspired Data Scientist ;) 
- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems and looking at things with different perspectives. 
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in IBM Data Science Professional Cert. program on Coursera. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects, espcially in healthcare, to advance my skills and expand my horizon.

- 😄 Pronouns: I identify myself as a conservative lol. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to live (like a nun) and volunteer in a monastery for over 6 years.
